    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a dish 
        you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes. It doesn't get much easier than this 
        by cooking everything in one pot. Switch it up by using ground beef, chicken, or turkey 
        along with any other of your favorite ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas and carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen corn</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat sesame oil and olive oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 3 minutes, flipping halfway through.
        </li>
            
        <li>
            Remove shrimp from the skillet using a slotted spoon, allowing oils and cooking juices to remain in the skillet. Place shrimp on a plate and set aside.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Add peas and carrots and corn to the skillet and cook, stirring intermittently, until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Push vegetables to the side of the skillet, pour eggs into the other side, and cook to scramble, stirring as necessary, 3 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Stir shrimp, rice, and green onions into the skillet. Drizzle evenly with soy sauce, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until shrimp is reheated through, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
